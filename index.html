            Our genetic research gives everyday people the opportunity to make a
            difference by participating in a new kind of research —online, from
            anywhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once participants answer online survey questions, researchers link
            their genetic data to study topics from ancestry, to traits, to
            disease. These contributions help drive scientific discoveries.
          </p>
          <p>
            The choice to opt into or out of research is always up to the
            participant.

            There are certain diseases that matter to you personally. We now
            have a way for you to participate in clinical trials and help assess
            new treatments for these diseases that might impact you or a loved
            one.
          </p>
          <p>
            We collaborate with pharmaceutical companies to bring you
            opportunities to participate in clinical trials that evaluate
            treatments for diseases you care about. You get to decide whether
            you’d like to participate, and are welcome to opt out whenever you
            want.

            On average, a customer who chooses to opt into research contributes
            to over 230 studies on topics that range from Parkinson's disease to
            lupus to asthma and more.

            With the help of our 23andMe community we believe we can accelerate
            research and make an impact with our genetic data.
